Simulation variants

- 3: for the 3rd iteration of the UI
  - 3a: initial implementation of the simulation, taking a back-walking approach starting from the outputs.
  - 3b: simulation taking a front-walking approach starting from the inputs, this one is capable of handling loops, but has some bugs
  - 3c: reimplementation of 3b, with clearer code and proper handling of loops
